what i build in this project 
This tax calculation tool calculates taxes based on overall income after deductions, with specific rates for different age groups, and it does not tax income under 8 Lakhs. It features user-friendly design elements, such as error icons for incorrect inputs and a modal display of final calculations upon submission, without restricting the entry of non-numeric characters in number fields.

Tech Stack used  :  HTML , CSS and js
